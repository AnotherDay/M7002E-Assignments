About the tech demo
-------------------

You character starts off in a dungeon and classic game fashion you have no memory of how you got there. In this space you have some storage crates, a wand which controls the torches in the room and a strange key. All of these objects can be picked up and dragged around with drag and drop functionality. 
The key and the wand are special items and can be used by pressing E. Using the key unlocks the Jedi mode which is activated by pressing the G key. Objects can then be selected from a far with the left mouse key and when they are selected you can control the object with the UIOJKL key (instructions are displayed in the top right corner). 
If the room is not dark enough you can turn the torches on or off by first picking up the wand with the E key, aim on a torch and then press the left mouse button.
